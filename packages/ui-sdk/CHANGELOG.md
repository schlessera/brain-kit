- 2be49b8: Stage an incoming system share on the server

  First phase of making the chat UI a share target on Android: `POST /api/share`
  accepts a multipart share (title, text, url, and up to ten files) and writes it
  to `<brain root>/.brain-ui/inbox/<id>/` alongside a `meta.json` manifest, so the
  agent can read, file and process it as an ordinary chat turn. Nothing enters the
  content repo until the agent decides where it belongs.

  Everything a share carries is attacker-influenced — file names come from
  whichever app invoked the share sheet — and the consumer is an agent with file
  and shell tools, which sets the bar for "sanitized": a name is not safe merely
  because the filesystem accepts it. The staging directory's name is minted
  server-side and no part of the payload is ever treated as a path. Names go
  through an ALLOWLIST — Unicode letters, digits, marks and `._-` — rather than a
  list of characters someone thought to forbid, because `photo$(curl evil).jpg`
  survives any such list and correct quoting by the agent is not a boundary.
  Format characters go too: bidi overrides, zero-width spaces and the Unicode tag
  block, from the text fields as well as the names, since all of them are quoted
  into a prompt and all of them are invisible to the human reading it. Names are
  bounded, given an extension from their media type when they have none, and
  de-duplicated rather than overwritten;
  `meta.json` is reserved — case-insensitively, since on macOS and Windows
  `META.JSON` and `meta.json` are one file — and the length bound counts UTF-8
  bytes rather than characters, because a filesystem component limit is a byte
  limit and a hundred CJK characters are three hundred bytes.

  Caps (`SHARE_MAX_FILES`, `SHARE_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, `SHARE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`,
  `SHARE_MAX_TEXT_BYTES`) are counted off the request stream rather than trusted
  from `content-length`, which HTTP/2 and chunked encoding omit entirely, then
  again against each part's claimed size and once more against the decoded bytes.
  A share is staged into `.<id>.partial` and renamed into place only once
  `meta.json` is written, so the agent cannot observe a half-written share even if
  the process is killed mid-write — which `try`/`catch` cleanup cannot cover. One
  unwritable file is recorded as `skipped` rather than losing the other four.

  Two fields that reach the agent are now validated rather than passed through: a
  `url` that is not http(s) is demoted to plain text, because the filing skill
  dereferences that field and `javascript:`, `data:` and `file:///etc/shadow` all
  arrive as plausible strings; and a media type that is not a media type becomes
  `application/octet-stream` instead of being quoted back into the prompt at
  whatever length the sender chose.

  `POST /api/share` also refuses a cross-site request. Every other state-changing
  route here reads JSON, which forces a preflight and is CSRF-safe by accident; a
  multipart POST is CORS-simple and gets no preflight, and under
  `AUTH_MODE=tailscale` the credential is the source IP, so no SameSite flag
  applies either. Concurrent intakes are capped, the inbox is capped at
  `SHARE_MAX_STAGED` shares, and the prune sweep is debounced instead of running
  on every upload. A failure mid-write removes the partial directory. Staged shares older than `SHARE_STAGING_TTL_MS`
  (7 days) are pruned opportunistically on each intake, and `pruneShareStaging()`
  is exported so a deployment can also sweep at boot.

  `template/.gitignore` now ignores `.brain-ui/`, which it never did — so a
  generated brain repo would have staged a share (and the keyterm and model
  caches) into git on the next `git add -A`.

  The route is mounted behind the auth guard, which is the whole defense for
  something that writes into the brain root — a wiring test now asserts it.

  A second, public route answers `POST /share-target` when no service worker was
  there to intercept it (evicted, storage cleared, or installed before the worker
  activated) with a redirect into the app instead of a bare 404 — the SPA fallback
  is GET-only, so without it the user gets a raw error page inside the app window.
  It reads no body and must stay outside the guard: a share navigation is
  cross-site, so the SameSite=Strict cookie is absent by construction.

  The service-worker share-target handler, the client intake, and the manifest
  entry in the deployment shell follow in later phases.

- 2be49b8: Answer a system share in the service worker

  Second phase of the Android share target: `@schlessera/brain-ui-sdk/share-target`
  is a new export holding the service-worker half — `registerShareTarget()`,
  `handleShareTargetRequest()`, and an IndexedDB store that parks the payload
  until the app can upload it.

  A POST share target is a cross-site POST _navigation_, and it has to be answered
  locally rather than by a server route, for two independent reasons. The session
  cookie is `SameSite=Strict`, which is exactly the case such a navigation does not
  carry — a server route would see an unauthenticated request with the payload
  already consumed and unrecoverable. And answering locally keeps the payload on
  the device until the app is authenticated and online, so a share made offline or
  logged out is queued rather than lost. The handler therefore stashes the payload
  and redirects to the app with `?share=<id>`.

  It never rejects and never hangs: a browser mid-navigation has to land
  somewhere, so a body that will not parse (what Chrome produces when the
  manifest's `accept` lists an extension without its MIME type), an empty share, a
  share past the caps, or a store that refuses — or takes longer than five seconds
  to accept — the write each redirect with `?share_error=` for the app to explain.
  The timeout matters because `indexedDB.open()` can hang with no event at all on
  a corrupted backing store, and an unsettled response promise is a blank tab.

  The caps the server enforces are enforced here too, before anything touches the
  device: an oversized body is refused on `content-length` before `formData()`
  buffers it whole in the worker, and file count, per-file size, total size and
  text length are checked after parsing. Otherwise a share is written to the
  user's own phone first and only refused minutes later, on upload.

  `ShareStore.take()` reads and deletes in one transaction. The shell reloads
  itself when a new worker takes over and a reload keeps the query string, so
  `?share=<id>` can be read twice; the atomic claim is what stops one share being
  filed into the knowledge base twice.

  Anything reachable by the share sheet is also reachable by any website — a page
  that auto-submits a cross-site form to the action URL is indistinguishable from
  a real share, and `Sec-Fetch-Site` cannot tell them apart from inside a worker.
  A stashed share is therefore untrusted input, and the client intake that follows
  shows it on a confirmation card rather than acting on it.

  The stash is bounded: after each successful stash the handler prunes records
  older than `SHARE_STASH_TTL_MS` (24h), so a share abandoned behind a login
  prompt does not sit on the device holding whole files forever.

  No Workbox dependency — a plain `fetch` listener works with or without a router,
  and Workbox's own routes are GET-only by default, so nothing competes for the
  POST. It is a separate export subpath so a service worker can import it without
  dragging in the renderer and ASR registries that `./client` holds. Persistence
  stays concrete — the swap and in-memory implementations are named `*ForTests`
  and are not part of the package's public exports, so this is a test hook and
  not a storage seam.

  `@schlessera/brain-ui-react` gains a dev-only `ShareHarness` component: it posts
  the same multipart body to the same path from inside the page, through exactly
  the same handler, stash and redirect. Everything except the manifest
  registration itself can be verified without reinstalling the PWA — which on
  Android means waiting for a WebAPK update.

### Patch Changes

- 4281c59: Fix three things a real session on a phone turned up

  - **Images written into the brain did not display in chat.** The markdown
    renderer overrode headings, code and links but not `img`, so
    `![](assets/images/x.png)` resolved against the app origin and 404'd — the
    bytes are served by the files API. Repo-relative sources are now rewritten to
    that endpoint; `data:` URIs and absolute URLs pass through untouched.
  - **Scratch files had nowhere to go.** `brain render` and `brain image` refused
    any path outside the repo, which pushed intermediates — an HTML file that
    exists to be rendered two seconds later — into a knowledge base as git noise.
    Both now also accept paths under the system temp directory, report them
    absolute, and say that a file written there is not viewable in a UI. Anywhere
    else is still refused: this is scratch space, not free rein.
  - **The generate-pdf skill refused documents over 400 KB**, citing a file-viewer
    download limit that does not exist. The real ceiling is the file server's
    (10 MB, both the preview and raw paths); below that, size is a judgement call
    about the reader's connection. The skill no longer refuses to produce a
    document for being over an invented figure.

  Also corrects a comment on `FILE_SIZE_CAP_BYTES` claiming the `?raw=1` path was
  unbounded. It is not — `resolveForRaw` enforces the same cap, which is why
  raising it to 10 MB mattered for images and PDFs in the viewer too.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 604abbc: Add a mask bridge: the reader paints the region an image edit applies to

  Masked inpainting needs someone to point at part of a picture, and there is no
  server-side substitute for that. This mirrors the existing location bridge: the
  agent calls `mcp__brain-ui__request_image_mask`, the browser opens a canvas over
  the image, and the painted PNG comes back over the socket.

  - **ui-sdk** — `mask_request` / `mask_response` / `mask_error` frames, validated
    at the boundary with the same decoded-byte budget as a chat image, plus
    `BackendBridge.requestMask`.
  - **ui-server** — pending-mask state on the turn coordinator, the bridge method,
    and inbound routing. Cancels reject the promise like every other pending
    interactive request, so a disconnect mid-paint fails the tool instead of
    hanging the turn.
  - **ui-react** — a `MaskEditor` modal: paint with a sized brush, undo, clear.
    Strokes are drawn on a capped working canvas and rescaled to the source
    image's true pixel dimensions on export, so a mask drawn on a phone lines up
    with a 4K original. Painted pixels export as fully transparent, which is the
    convention the edit endpoint reads.
  - **ui-backend-claude** — the tool, auto-allowed like the other bridge tools
    (the editor itself is the approval), and a system-prompt line telling the
    agent to ask rather than guess coordinates.

  The mask is written next to its image and the path returned, because what
  consumes it is `brain image --mask <path>`.

- cdfa039: Raise the preview, upload and share size limits to match the frame budget

  The socket already accepts ~12MB inbound (brain-ui sets `maxPayloadLength` to
  `MAX_CLIENT_FRAME_BYTES + 64KB`), but the limits layered above it were never
  lifted to use that headroom. Worst case today was 6MB decoded — about 8MB once
  base64 inflates it — against a 12MB frame.

  - `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` 2MB → 4MB. This mostly governs GIFs: everything else is
    downscaled to 1568px and re-encoded to JPEG client-side, landing far below
    either number, while a GIF passes through untouched so its animation
    survives.
  - `MAX_TOTAL_IMAGE_BYTES` 6MB → 8MB, which is ~10.7MB base64 and still leaves
    the JSON envelope room inside the 12MB frame.
  - `FILE_SIZE_CAP_BYTES` 5MB → 10MB for the JSON preview path. Raw bytes
    (`?raw=1`) stream from disk and were never bounded by it, so this only ever
    affected text previews.
  - Render/share content 512KB → 4MB. That bound predated inlined assets: a
    shared document carries `data:` image URIs and pre-rendered mermaid SVGs,
    which pass 512KB without the prose being long. It is an HTTP body, not a
    socket frame.

  Left alone: `MAX_WS_MESSAGE_BYTES` (512KB, server → client). That one bounds
  what the browser renders and what reverse proxies will pass, which is a
  different risk than what the user can send.

### Minor Changes

- 1f7e6a3: Added: mermaid diagrams get their own share menu (PNG / PDF / SVG / source) and a
  full-screen pan-and-zoom viewer, opened by tapping the diagram.
  Added: a chat-surface brief appended to the agent's system prompt —
  `buildSystemPromptAppend({ client, tools })` — covering diagrams, `<share>`
  blocks, wikilinks, raw-HTML and tool-narration rules, the ask-user and location
  tools, and what the reader's device can do. Each backend declares its own tool
  names (pi has no location tool), and both take a `systemPromptAppend` option to
  override the whole brief.
  Added: `chat_message` frames carry an optional `client` field
  (`ClientEnvironment`: form factor, touch, standalone, camera, microphone,
  geolocation, share sheet, viewport, locale, timezone), feature-detected in the
  browser and validated strictly at the boundary. The Claude backend rebuilds its
  system-prompt append per turn from it.
  Changed: diagrams render in a theme built from the app's own tokens instead of
  mermaid's stock dark/neutral themes; exports use the matching light theme.
  Changed: `MermaidTheme` is now `"dark" | "light"` (was `"dark" | "neutral"`),
  `ShareMenu`'s `renderTrigger` also receives `status` and `icon`, and the
  server-internal `handleChatMessage` takes an options object.

  access; a full-screen GraphPage with Clusters, Discovery, Local, and

### Minor Changes

- 2904074: - Added: the model picker is discovered from the Anthropic Models API, so a new
  model appears without an env edit or a redeploy.
  - Added: a Settings screen (Models | Security) to hide models from the picker
    and refresh the list on demand.
  - Added: `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_DISCOVERY` and `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_TTL_HOURS`.
  - Changed: `BRAIN_UI_CLAUDE_PROFILES` is now only for non-Anthropic endpoints
    and for overriding a discovered model.
  - Changed: `useUIStore`'s `securityPanelOpen` / `toggleSecurityPanel` /
    `setSecurityPanelOpen` are now `settingsPanelOpen` / `toggleSettingsPanel` /
    `setSettingsPanelOpen`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c42696: Extract the brain-ui deployment into two reusable packages.

  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-server`**: Hono app factory (`createApp`) with
    auth (password/passkeys/tailscale/proxy), the WebSocket turn coordinator
    (decomposed into explicit host objects: `WsHost`, `TurnCoordinator`,
    `SessionCatalog`), session catalog with bundled SQLite migrations, brain/
    files/voice routes, and injected seams for the static client build and the
    PNG/PDF renderer.
  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-react`**: the chat/files/voice React components,
    stores, and WS transport. The chat store now keeps a transcript buffer per
    session (plus a draft buffer), so background sessions accumulate instead of
    being discarded. Ships prebuilt JS + d.ts, a precompiled `styles.css`, and a
    `theme.css` source entry for Tailwind v4 consumers. Branding copy is
    configurable via `configureBrainUi()`.
  - **ui-sdk**: add `PasskeySummary` to the protocol (REST payload of the
    passkey management routes, previously local to brain-ui).

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish with correct internal dependency pins. The 0.2.0 manifests pinned
  cross-dependencies to 0.1.0, a version that was never published, making five
  of the eight packages uninstallable.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- rename brainform to brain-kit
