## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- 4281c59: Fix three things a real session on a phone turned up

  - **Images written into the brain did not display in chat.** The markdown
    renderer overrode headings, code and links but not `img`, so
    `![](assets/images/x.png)` resolved against the app origin and 404'd — the
    bytes are served by the files API. Repo-relative sources are now rewritten to
    that endpoint; `data:` URIs and absolute URLs pass through untouched.
  - **Scratch files had nowhere to go.** `brain render` and `brain image` refused
    any path outside the repo, which pushed intermediates — an HTML file that
    exists to be rendered two seconds later — into a knowledge base as git noise.
    Both now also accept paths under the system temp directory, report them
    absolute, and say that a file written there is not viewable in a UI. Anywhere
    else is still refused: this is scratch space, not free rein.
  - **The generate-pdf skill refused documents over 400 KB**, citing a file-viewer
    download limit that does not exist. The real ceiling is the file server's
    (10 MB, both the preview and raw paths); below that, size is a judgement call
    about the reader's connection. The skill no longer refuses to produce a
    document for being over an invented figure.

  Also corrects a comment on `FILE_SIZE_CAP_BYTES` claiming the `?raw=1` path was
  unbounded. It is not — `resolveForRaw` enforces the same cap, which is why
  raising it to 10 MB mattered for images and PDFs in the viewer too.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 604abbc: Add a mask bridge: the reader paints the region an image edit applies to

  Masked inpainting needs someone to point at part of a picture, and there is no
  server-side substitute for that. This mirrors the existing location bridge: the
  agent calls `mcp__brain-ui__request_image_mask`, the browser opens a canvas over
  the image, and the painted PNG comes back over the socket.

  - **ui-sdk** — `mask_request` / `mask_response` / `mask_error` frames, validated
    at the boundary with the same decoded-byte budget as a chat image, plus
    `BackendBridge.requestMask`.
  - **ui-server** — pending-mask state on the turn coordinator, the bridge method,
    and inbound routing. Cancels reject the promise like every other pending
    interactive request, so a disconnect mid-paint fails the tool instead of
    hanging the turn.
  - **ui-react** — a `MaskEditor` modal: paint with a sized brush, undo, clear.
    Strokes are drawn on a capped working canvas and rescaled to the source
    image's true pixel dimensions on export, so a mask drawn on a phone lines up
    with a 4K original. Painted pixels export as fully transparent, which is the
    convention the edit endpoint reads.
  - **ui-backend-claude** — the tool, auto-allowed like the other bridge tools
    (the editor itself is the approval), and a system-prompt line telling the
    agent to ask rather than guess coordinates.

  The mask is written next to its image and the path returned, because what
  consumes it is `brain image --mask <path>`.

- cdfa039: Raise the preview, upload and share size limits to match the frame budget

  The socket already accepts ~12MB inbound (brain-ui sets `maxPayloadLength` to
  `MAX_CLIENT_FRAME_BYTES + 64KB`), but the limits layered above it were never
  lifted to use that headroom. Worst case today was 6MB decoded — about 8MB once
  base64 inflates it — against a 12MB frame.

  - `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` 2MB → 4MB. This mostly governs GIFs: everything else is
    downscaled to 1568px and re-encoded to JPEG client-side, landing far below
    either number, while a GIF passes through untouched so its animation
    survives.
  - `MAX_TOTAL_IMAGE_BYTES` 6MB → 8MB, which is ~10.7MB base64 and still leaves
    the JSON envelope room inside the 12MB frame.
  - `FILE_SIZE_CAP_BYTES` 5MB → 10MB for the JSON preview path. Raw bytes
    (`?raw=1`) stream from disk and were never bounded by it, so this only ever
    affected text previews.
  - Render/share content 512KB → 4MB. That bound predated inlined assets: a
    shared document carries `data:` image URIs and pre-rendered mermaid SVGs,
    which pass 512KB without the prose being long. It is an HTTP body, not a
    socket frame.

  Left alone: `MAX_WS_MESSAGE_BYTES` (512KB, server → client). That one bounds
  what the browser renders and what reverse proxies will pass, which is a
  different risk than what the user can send.

## 0.10.0

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7e6a3: Added: mermaid diagrams get their own share menu (PNG / PDF / SVG / source) and a
  full-screen pan-and-zoom viewer, opened by tapping the diagram.
  Added: a chat-surface brief appended to the agent's system prompt —
  `buildSystemPromptAppend({ client, tools })` — covering diagrams, `<share>`
  blocks, wikilinks, raw-HTML and tool-narration rules, the ask-user and location
  tools, and what the reader's device can do. Each backend declares its own tool
  names (pi has no location tool), and both take a `systemPromptAppend` option to
  override the whole brief.
  Added: `chat_message` frames carry an optional `client` field
  (`ClientEnvironment`: form factor, touch, standalone, camera, microphone,
  geolocation, share sheet, viewport, locale, timezone), feature-detected in the
  browser and validated strictly at the boundary. The Claude backend rebuilds its
  system-prompt append per turn from it.
  Changed: diagrams render in a theme built from the app's own tokens instead of
  mermaid's stock dark/neutral themes; exports use the matching light theme.
  Changed: `MermaidTheme` is now `"dark" | "light"` (was `"dark" | "neutral"`),
  `ShareMenu`'s `renderTrigger` also receives `status` and `icon`, and the
  server-internal `handleChatMessage` takes an options object.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b8cbf72: Knowledge-graph view: `brain graph` command and schema-v8 derived tables
  (metrics, communities, root distances, precomputed ForceAtlas2 layout) built
  at index time; `/api/graph/*` REST endpoints served from read-only brain.db
  access; a full-screen GraphPage with Clusters, Discovery, Local, and
  Maintenance modes rendered via a lazy-loaded sigma.js WebGL canvas.

## 0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2904074: - Added: the model picker is discovered from the Anthropic Models API, so a new
  model appears without an env edit or a redeploy.
  - Added: a Settings screen (Models | Security) to hide models from the picker
    and refresh the list on demand.
  - Added: `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_DISCOVERY` and `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_TTL_HOURS`.
  - Changed: `BRAIN_UI_CLAUDE_PROFILES` is now only for non-Anthropic endpoints
    and for overriding a discovered model.
  - Changed: `useUIStore`'s `securityPanelOpen` / `toggleSecurityPanel` /
    `setSecurityPanelOpen` are now `settingsPanelOpen` / `toggleSettingsPanel` /
    `setSettingsPanelOpen`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c42696: Extract the brain-ui deployment into two reusable packages.

  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-server`**: Hono app factory (`createApp`) with
    auth (password/passkeys/tailscale/proxy), the WebSocket turn coordinator
    (decomposed into explicit host objects: `WsHost`, `TurnCoordinator`,
    `SessionCatalog`), session catalog with bundled SQLite migrations, brain/
    files/voice routes, and injected seams for the static client build and the
    PNG/PDF renderer.
  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-react`**: the chat/files/voice React components,
    stores, and WS transport. The chat store now keeps a transcript buffer per
    session (plus a draft buffer), so background sessions accumulate instead of
    being discarded. Ships prebuilt JS + d.ts, a precompiled `styles.css`, and a
    `theme.css` source entry for Tailwind v4 consumers. Branding copy is
    configurable via `configureBrainUi()`.
  - **ui-sdk**: add `PasskeySummary` to the protocol (REST payload of the
    passkey management routes, previously local to brain-ui).

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish with correct internal dependency pins. The 0.2.0 manifests pinned
  cross-dependencies to 0.1.0, a version that was never published, making five
  of the eight packages uninstallable.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- rename brainform to brain-kit
