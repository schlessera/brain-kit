# @schlessera/brain-module-jobs

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 59de559: - Added: every package reads the environment in one chokepoint that declares
  each variable, exports the contract (`ENV_VARS`, `resolveEnv`, `readEnvVar`)
  from the package entry, and generates its README env table from it.
  - Added: `ui-server` exports a resolved `ServerConfig` and returns an app handle
    (`config`, `db`, `wsHost`, `isTurnActive`, `cancelActiveTurns`, `close`), so
    two differently-configured apps coexist in one process.
  - Added: `openBrainDb`/`withBrainDb` gate every `brain.db` read on
    `schema_version`; `assertBackendResolvable` refuses to boot when the selected
    agent backend is not installed.
  - Changed: `@schlessera/brain-backend-claude` is an optional peer of
    `ui-server`, not a dependency — a deployment declares the backend it uses.
  - Changed: the module contract carries the config generic through
    `CommandContext`, `HygieneContext` and `CommandModule`, so a module author no
    longer casts a value the loader already validated.
  - Changed: the Gemini providers no longer delete and restore `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    around client construction.
  - Removed: `configureDb`, `getDb`, `closeDb`, `configureWsHost`,
    `defaultWsHost`, `cancelActiveTurn`, `isTurnActive`, the `brainClient`
    namespace and the `getBackends`/`getBackendsInfo` module functions — their
    replacements live on the app handle.

- 683f3e3: Rewrite every skill description as a trigger, not a summary

  A skill's description is the entire triggering mechanism — it is all an agent
  sees when deciding whether the skill is relevant to what the user just asked.
  Most of these descriptions were written as summaries: they led with what the
  skill does and how it works, and appended a short "Use when …" clause at the
  end. Some had no trigger at all.

  All 24 shipped descriptions now lead with the situation that should pull the
  skill in, phrased the way a user would actually put it, with mechanism left to
  the body where it belongs. `content-hygiene`, `sync` and `talk-ideas` gained a
  trigger they never had.

  Three CI gates keep it that way: shipped skills must lint clean (no errors _and_
  no warnings), must describe when to use them, and must stay within the
  specification's 1024-character cap.

### Minor Changes

- 0eb1b03: Ship three skills and make `jobs scrape` cover both source kinds in one run.

  - **Skills** (`jobs-review`, `research-opportunity`, `interview-scheduled`) — the
    module shipped a CLI and no skills, so the conversational half of the workflow
    lived only in the reference brain. Generalized: no personal names, CV variants,
    or example slugs, and they read the configured `criteria` file and
    `opportunitiesDir` rather than hardcoded paths.
  - **`scrape --browser` is now additive.** It ran _instead of_ the API pass, so no
    single invocation ever covered both — and the module's own cron entry therefore
    silently omitted every browser-only board. `--browser` now appends the Chrome
    pass to the API pass, `--browser-only` keeps the exclusive behavior, and the
    cron entry is `jobs scrape --all --browser`. The Chrome pass probes for a
    reachable browser first and skips with a clear message when there is none, so a
    host without Chrome loses the browser boards rather than the whole scrape.

### Patch Changes

- Republish with correct internal dependency pins. The 0.2.0 manifests pinned
  cross-dependencies to 0.1.0, a version that was never published, making five
  of the eight packages uninstallable.
