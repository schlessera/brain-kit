### Minor Changes

- 604abbc: Add a mask bridge: the reader paints the region an image edit applies to

  Masked inpainting needs someone to point at part of a picture, and there is no
  server-side substitute for that. This mirrors the existing location bridge: the
  agent calls `mcp__brain-ui__request_image_mask`, the browser opens a canvas over
  the image, and the painted PNG comes back over the socket.

  - **ui-sdk** — `mask_request` / `mask_response` / `mask_error` frames, validated
    at the boundary with the same decoded-byte budget as a chat image, plus
    `BackendBridge.requestMask`.
  - **ui-server** — pending-mask state on the turn coordinator, the bridge method,
    and inbound routing. Cancels reject the promise like every other pending
    interactive request, so a disconnect mid-paint fails the tool instead of
    hanging the turn.
  - **ui-react** — a `MaskEditor` modal: paint with a sized brush, undo, clear.
    Strokes are drawn on a capped working canvas and rescaled to the source
    image's true pixel dimensions on export, so a mask drawn on a phone lines up
    with a 4K original. Painted pixels export as fully transparent, which is the
    convention the edit endpoint reads.
  - **ui-backend-claude** — the tool, auto-allowed like the other bridge tools
    (the editor itself is the approval), and a system-prompt line telling the
    agent to ask rather than guess coordinates.

  The mask is written next to its image and the path returned, because what
  consumes it is `brain image --mask <path>`.

- cdfa039: Raise the preview, upload and share size limits to match the frame budget

  The socket already accepts ~12MB inbound (brain-ui sets `maxPayloadLength` to
  `MAX_CLIENT_FRAME_BYTES + 64KB`), but the limits layered above it were never
  lifted to use that headroom. Worst case today was 6MB decoded — about 8MB once
  base64 inflates it — against a 12MB frame.

  - `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` 2MB → 4MB. This mostly governs GIFs: everything else is
    downscaled to 1568px and re-encoded to JPEG client-side, landing far below
    either number, while a GIF passes through untouched so its animation
    survives.
  - `MAX_TOTAL_IMAGE_BYTES` 6MB → 8MB, which is ~10.7MB base64 and still leaves
    the JSON envelope room inside the 12MB frame.
  - `FILE_SIZE_CAP_BYTES` 5MB → 10MB for the JSON preview path. Raw bytes
    (`?raw=1`) stream from disk and were never bounded by it, so this only ever
    affected text previews.
  - Render/share content 512KB → 4MB. That bound predated inlined assets: a
    shared document carries `data:` image URIs and pre-rendered mermaid SVGs,
    which pass 512KB without the prose being long. It is an HTTP body, not a
    socket frame.

  Left alone: `MAX_WS_MESSAGE_BYTES` (512KB, server → client). That one bounds
  what the browser renders and what reverse proxies will pass, which is a
  different risk than what the user can send.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 50f6ec7: Add `brain render` — documents to PDF, PNG, or standalone HTML from the CLI

  PDF generation existed in brain-kit already, but only over HTTP: the UI posted
  content to `/api/render`, which wrapped it in a document template and drove the
  headless Chrome in `@schlessera/brain-render-puppeteer`. Nothing on the command
  line could reach it, so agents and skills that wanted a shareable file shelled
  out to a browser themselves and re-invented the layout each time.

  - **New package `@schlessera/brain-render-template`** holds the markdown/HTML →
    print-ready document shell (marked plus the stylesheet), extracted from
    ui-server. Both callers now share it, so a page shared from the app and a PDF
    produced on the command line are byte-identical for identical input.
  - **New command `brain render <path|->`** with `--format pdf|png|html`. It
    strips frontmatter, takes the title from it, defaults the output path to the
    input with the format's extension, and refuses to write outside the brain
    root. `--format html` needs no browser at all.
  - **Remote images** stay blocked by default — the rendered page resolves no
    hostname, so a remote `<img>` becomes a visible `[alt — not embedded]`
    placeholder. The new repeatable `--allow-host` opens specific image hosts,
    passing the same allowlist to both the placeholdering and the renderer.
  - **New core skill `generate-pdf`** drives the command. It declares no `requires:`
    beyond `brain` itself.
  - `@schlessera/brain-render-puppeteer` becomes an optional peer of core, resolved
    dynamically like `@google/genai`: a missing renderer produces install
    instructions rather than a module-resolution stack trace.

  Also fixes a latent bug in the image placeholdering that ui-server shipped: the
  `<img>` match used `[^>]*` for attributes, so a `>` inside an earlier quoted
  attribute (`alt="<b>x</b>"`) truncated the match and let the remote image
  through unplaceholdered, to render as a broken-image box.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7e6a3: Added: mermaid diagrams get their own share menu (PNG / PDF / SVG / source) and a
  full-screen pan-and-zoom viewer, opened by tapping the diagram.
  Added: a chat-surface brief appended to the agent's system prompt —
  `buildSystemPromptAppend({ client, tools })` — covering diagrams, `<share>`
  blocks, wikilinks, raw-HTML and tool-narration rules, the ask-user and location
  tools, and what the reader's device can do. Each backend declares its own tool
  names (pi has no location tool), and both take a `systemPromptAppend` option to
  override the whole brief.
  Added: `chat_message` frames carry an optional `client` field
  (`ClientEnvironment`: form factor, touch, standalone, camera, microphone,
  geolocation, share sheet, viewport, locale, timezone), feature-detected in the
  browser and validated strictly at the boundary. The Claude backend rebuilds its
  system-prompt append per turn from it.
  Changed: diagrams render in a theme built from the app's own tokens instead of
  mermaid's stock dark/neutral themes; exports use the matching light theme.
  Changed: `MermaidTheme` is now `"dark" | "light"` (was `"dark" | "neutral"`),
  `ShareMenu`'s `renderTrigger` also receives `status` and `icon`, and the
  server-internal `handleChatMessage` takes an options object.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2868ba6: Mermaid diagram support across all render surfaces.

  - ` ```mermaid ` (and ` ```mmd `) fences render as diagrams in chat messages,
    the markdown file previewer, `<share>` block previews, Write-tool previews,
    and the "What's up" briefing — one hook in `BrainMarkdown`, so every surface
    gets it.
  - Streaming-safe: while a fence is still arriving the raw source shows as an
    ordinary code block; debounced parses (with a 400ms throttle floor) upgrade
    it to a diagram as soon as the source parses, and a failed parse keeps the
    last good SVG instead of flashing an error. Renders are cached, so per-token
    re-renders of a streaming message cost a lookup.
  - Mermaid (~2MB) loads lazily on first diagram; `securityLevel: "strict"` and
    `suppressErrorRendering` are set.
  - Share as PNG/PDF pre-renders fences to inline SVG on the client
    (`inlineMermaidDiagrams`, light "neutral" theme) before `POST /api/render`,
    since the render page runs without JavaScript or network. ui-server's share
    template gained matching `.mermaid-figure` styles.
  - Standalone `.mmd` / `.mermaid` files get a diagram preview (with the usual
    preview/raw toggle) in the file viewer.
  - `BrainMarkdown`'s component overrides are now identity-stable across
    renders, so streaming deltas no longer unmount/remount every code block.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c42696: Extract the brain-ui deployment into two reusable packages.

  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-server`**: Hono app factory (`createApp`) with
    auth (password/passkeys/tailscale/proxy), the WebSocket turn coordinator
    (decomposed into explicit host objects: `WsHost`, `TurnCoordinator`,
    `SessionCatalog`), session catalog with bundled SQLite migrations, brain/
    files/voice routes, and injected seams for the static client build and the
    PNG/PDF renderer.
  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-react`**: the chat/files/voice React components,
    stores, and WS transport. The chat store now keeps a transcript buffer per
    session (plus a draft buffer), so background sessions accumulate instead of
    being discarded. Ships prebuilt JS + d.ts, a precompiled `styles.css`, and a
    `theme.css` source entry for Tailwind v4 consumers. Branding copy is
    configurable via `configureBrainUi()`.
  - **ui-sdk**: add `PasskeySummary` to the protocol (REST payload of the
    passkey management routes, previously local to brain-ui).

### Patch Changes
