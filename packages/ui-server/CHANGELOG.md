# @schlessera/brain-ui-server

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 59de559: - Added: every package reads the environment in one chokepoint that declares
  each variable, exports the contract (`ENV_VARS`, `resolveEnv`, `readEnvVar`)
  from the package entry, and generates its README env table from it.
  - Added: `ui-server` exports a resolved `ServerConfig` and returns an app handle
    (`config`, `db`, `wsHost`, `isTurnActive`, `cancelActiveTurns`, `close`), so
    two differently-configured apps coexist in one process.
  - Added: `openBrainDb`/`withBrainDb` gate every `brain.db` read on
    `schema_version`; `assertBackendResolvable` refuses to boot when the selected
    agent backend is not installed.
  - Changed: `@schlessera/brain-backend-claude` is an optional peer of
    `ui-server`, not a dependency — a deployment declares the backend it uses.
  - Changed: the module contract carries the config generic through
    `CommandContext`, `HygieneContext` and `CommandModule`, so a module author no
    longer casts a value the loader already validated.
  - Changed: the Gemini providers no longer delete and restore `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    around client construction.
  - Removed: `configureDb`, `getDb`, `closeDb`, `configureWsHost`,
    `defaultWsHost`, `cancelActiveTurn`, `isTurnActive`, the `brainClient`
    namespace and the `getBackends`/`getBackendsInfo` module functions — their
    replacements live on the app handle.

### Minor Changes

- e7e0092: Bound a session's follow-up queue by bytes instead of by message count

  `MAX_SESSION_QUEUE = 5` was a placeholder with no reasoning behind it, and it
  measured the wrong thing: a queue of five sentences and a queue of five
  four-image messages differ by roughly 50 MB, and only the second is a problem.
  Every queued entry is held in the host process (attachments still base64) until
  its turn runs.

  - **20 MiB warns, 50 MiB refuses.** Past the warn mark the message is still
    accepted and the `queued` status carries a `detail` note saying how much is
    parked; the server logs it too. Past the hard cap it is refused with
    `SESSION_QUEUE_FULL`, naming both the parked total and what the rejected
    message needed — an explicit error frame, never a silent drop.
  - **`MAX_SESSION_QUEUE` survives as a depth backstop, raised to 50.** Bytes do
    not bound count, and each entry becomes its own turn: ~500k one-line messages
    fit inside 50 MiB and would run a session for days.
  - `queuedFollowUpBytes` / `queuedBytes` (ui-server `ws/turns`) do the
    accounting, measuring the payload as it arrived on the wire.
  - The client stores the note per session (`queueNotes`) and the session drawer's
    Queued pill turns red and shows it on hover.

  Only affects backends without native follow-up — with `capabilities.followUp`
  (pi) messages go into the running turn and no host queue exists. The default
  Claude backend is the one that queues.

- 2be49b8: Stage an incoming system share on the server

  First phase of making the chat UI a share target on Android: `POST /api/share`
  accepts a multipart share (title, text, url, and up to ten files) and writes it
  to `<brain root>/.brain-ui/inbox/<id>/` alongside a `meta.json` manifest, so the
  agent can read, file and process it as an ordinary chat turn. Nothing enters the
  content repo until the agent decides where it belongs.

  Everything a share carries is attacker-influenced — file names come from
  whichever app invoked the share sheet — and the consumer is an agent with file
  and shell tools, which sets the bar for "sanitized": a name is not safe merely
  because the filesystem accepts it. The staging directory's name is minted
  server-side and no part of the payload is ever treated as a path. Names go
  through an ALLOWLIST — Unicode letters, digits, marks and `._-` — rather than a
  list of characters someone thought to forbid, because `photo$(curl evil).jpg`
  survives any such list and correct quoting by the agent is not a boundary.
  Format characters go too: bidi overrides, zero-width spaces and the Unicode tag
  block, from the text fields as well as the names, since all of them are quoted
  into a prompt and all of them are invisible to the human reading it. Names are
  bounded, given an extension from their media type when they have none, and
  de-duplicated rather than overwritten;
  `meta.json` is reserved — case-insensitively, since on macOS and Windows
  `META.JSON` and `meta.json` are one file — and the length bound counts UTF-8
  bytes rather than characters, because a filesystem component limit is a byte
  limit and a hundred CJK characters are three hundred bytes.

  Caps (`SHARE_MAX_FILES`, `SHARE_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, `SHARE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`,
  `SHARE_MAX_TEXT_BYTES`) are counted off the request stream rather than trusted
  from `content-length`, which HTTP/2 and chunked encoding omit entirely, then
  again against each part's claimed size and once more against the decoded bytes.
  A share is staged into `.<id>.partial` and renamed into place only once
  `meta.json` is written, so the agent cannot observe a half-written share even if
  the process is killed mid-write — which `try`/`catch` cleanup cannot cover. One
  unwritable file is recorded as `skipped` rather than losing the other four.

  Two fields that reach the agent are now validated rather than passed through: a
  `url` that is not http(s) is demoted to plain text, because the filing skill
  dereferences that field and `javascript:`, `data:` and `file:///etc/shadow` all
  arrive as plausible strings; and a media type that is not a media type becomes
  `application/octet-stream` instead of being quoted back into the prompt at
  whatever length the sender chose.

  `POST /api/share` also refuses a cross-site request. Every other state-changing
  route here reads JSON, which forces a preflight and is CSRF-safe by accident; a
  multipart POST is CORS-simple and gets no preflight, and under
  `AUTH_MODE=tailscale` the credential is the source IP, so no SameSite flag
  applies either. Concurrent intakes are capped, the inbox is capped at
  `SHARE_MAX_STAGED` shares, and the prune sweep is debounced instead of running
  on every upload. A failure mid-write removes the partial directory. Staged shares older than `SHARE_STAGING_TTL_MS`
  (7 days) are pruned opportunistically on each intake, and `pruneShareStaging()`
  is exported so a deployment can also sweep at boot.

  `template/.gitignore` now ignores `.brain-ui/`, which it never did — so a
  generated brain repo would have staged a share (and the keyterm and model
  caches) into git on the next `git add -A`.

  The route is mounted behind the auth guard, which is the whole defense for
  something that writes into the brain root — a wiring test now asserts it.

  A second, public route answers `POST /share-target` when no service worker was
  there to intercept it (evicted, storage cleared, or installed before the worker
  activated) with a redirect into the app instead of a bare 404 — the SPA fallback
  is GET-only, so without it the user gets a raw error page inside the app window.
  It reads no body and must stay outside the guard: a share navigation is
  cross-site, so the SameSite=Strict cookie is absent by construction.

  The service-worker share-target handler, the client intake, and the manifest
  entry in the deployment shell follow in later phases.

### Minor Changes

- 604abbc: Add a mask bridge: the reader paints the region an image edit applies to

  Masked inpainting needs someone to point at part of a picture, and there is no
  server-side substitute for that. This mirrors the existing location bridge: the
  agent calls `mcp__brain-ui__request_image_mask`, the browser opens a canvas over
  the image, and the painted PNG comes back over the socket.

  - **ui-sdk** — `mask_request` / `mask_response` / `mask_error` frames, validated
    at the boundary with the same decoded-byte budget as a chat image, plus
    `BackendBridge.requestMask`.
  - **ui-server** — pending-mask state on the turn coordinator, the bridge method,
    and inbound routing. Cancels reject the promise like every other pending
    interactive request, so a disconnect mid-paint fails the tool instead of
    hanging the turn.
  - **ui-react** — a `MaskEditor` modal: paint with a sized brush, undo, clear.
    Strokes are drawn on a capped working canvas and rescaled to the source
    image's true pixel dimensions on export, so a mask drawn on a phone lines up
    with a 4K original. Painted pixels export as fully transparent, which is the
    convention the edit endpoint reads.
  - **ui-backend-claude** — the tool, auto-allowed like the other bridge tools
    (the editor itself is the approval), and a system-prompt line telling the
    agent to ask rather than guess coordinates.

  The mask is written next to its image and the path returned, because what
  consumes it is `brain image --mask <path>`.

- cdfa039: Raise the preview, upload and share size limits to match the frame budget

  The socket already accepts ~12MB inbound (brain-ui sets `maxPayloadLength` to
  `MAX_CLIENT_FRAME_BYTES + 64KB`), but the limits layered above it were never
  lifted to use that headroom. Worst case today was 6MB decoded — about 8MB once
  base64 inflates it — against a 12MB frame.

  - `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` 2MB → 4MB. This mostly governs GIFs: everything else is
    downscaled to 1568px and re-encoded to JPEG client-side, landing far below
    either number, while a GIF passes through untouched so its animation
    survives.
  - `MAX_TOTAL_IMAGE_BYTES` 6MB → 8MB, which is ~10.7MB base64 and still leaves
    the JSON envelope room inside the 12MB frame.
  - `FILE_SIZE_CAP_BYTES` 5MB → 10MB for the JSON preview path. Raw bytes
    (`?raw=1`) stream from disk and were never bounded by it, so this only ever
    affected text previews.
  - Render/share content 512KB → 4MB. That bound predated inlined assets: a
    shared document carries `data:` image URIs and pre-rendered mermaid SVGs,
    which pass 512KB without the prose being long. It is an HTTP body, not a
    socket frame.

  Left alone: `MAX_WS_MESSAGE_BYTES` (512KB, server → client). That one bounds
  what the browser renders and what reverse proxies will pass, which is a
  different risk than what the user can send.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 50f6ec7: Add `brain render` — documents to PDF, PNG, or standalone HTML from the CLI

  PDF generation existed in brain-kit already, but only over HTTP: the UI posted
  content to `/api/render`, which wrapped it in a document template and drove the
  headless Chrome in `@schlessera/brain-render-puppeteer`. Nothing on the command
  line could reach it, so agents and skills that wanted a shareable file shelled
  out to a browser themselves and re-invented the layout each time.

  - **New package `@schlessera/brain-render-template`** holds the markdown/HTML →
    print-ready document shell (marked plus the stylesheet), extracted from
    ui-server. Both callers now share it, so a page shared from the app and a PDF
    produced on the command line are byte-identical for identical input.
  - **New command `brain render <path|->`** with `--format pdf|png|html`. It
    strips frontmatter, takes the title from it, defaults the output path to the
    input with the format's extension, and refuses to write outside the brain
    root. `--format html` needs no browser at all.
  - **Remote images** stay blocked by default — the rendered page resolves no
    hostname, so a remote `<img>` becomes a visible `[alt — not embedded]`
    placeholder. The new repeatable `--allow-host` opens specific image hosts,
    passing the same allowlist to both the placeholdering and the renderer.
  - **New core skill `generate-pdf`** drives the command. It declares no `requires:`
    beyond `brain` itself.
  - `@schlessera/brain-render-puppeteer` becomes an optional peer of core, resolved
    dynamically like `@google/genai`: a missing renderer produces install
    instructions rather than a module-resolution stack trace.

  Also fixes a latent bug in the image placeholdering that ui-server shipped: the
  `<img>` match used `[^>]*` for attributes, so a `>` inside an earlier quoted
  attribute (`alt="<b>x</b>"`) truncated the match and let the remote image
  through unplaceholdered, to render as a broken-image box.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7e6a3: Added: mermaid diagrams get their own share menu (PNG / PDF / SVG / source) and a
  full-screen pan-and-zoom viewer, opened by tapping the diagram.
  Added: a chat-surface brief appended to the agent's system prompt —
  `buildSystemPromptAppend({ client, tools })` — covering diagrams, `<share>`
  blocks, wikilinks, raw-HTML and tool-narration rules, the ask-user and location
  tools, and what the reader's device can do. Each backend declares its own tool
  names (pi has no location tool), and both take a `systemPromptAppend` option to
  override the whole brief.
  Added: `chat_message` frames carry an optional `client` field
  (`ClientEnvironment`: form factor, touch, standalone, camera, microphone,
  geolocation, share sheet, viewport, locale, timezone), feature-detected in the
  browser and validated strictly at the boundary. The Claude backend rebuilds its
  system-prompt append per turn from it.
  Changed: diagrams render in a theme built from the app's own tokens instead of
  mermaid's stock dark/neutral themes; exports use the matching light theme.
  Changed: `MermaidTheme` is now `"dark" | "light"` (was `"dark" | "neutral"`),
  `ShareMenu`'s `renderTrigger` also receives `status` and `icon`, and the
  server-internal `handleChatMessage` takes an options object.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2868ba6: Mermaid diagram support across all render surfaces.

  - ` ```mermaid ` (and ` ```mmd `) fences render as diagrams in chat messages,
    the markdown file previewer, `<share>` block previews, Write-tool previews,
    and the "What's up" briefing — one hook in `BrainMarkdown`, so every surface
    gets it.
  - Streaming-safe: while a fence is still arriving the raw source shows as an
    ordinary code block; debounced parses (with a 400ms throttle floor) upgrade
    it to a diagram as soon as the source parses, and a failed parse keeps the
    last good SVG instead of flashing an error. Renders are cached, so per-token
    re-renders of a streaming message cost a lookup.
  - Mermaid (~2MB) loads lazily on first diagram; `securityLevel: "strict"` and
    `suppressErrorRendering` are set.
  - Share as PNG/PDF pre-renders fences to inline SVG on the client
    (`inlineMermaidDiagrams`, light "neutral" theme) before `POST /api/render`,
    since the render page runs without JavaScript or network. ui-server's share
    template gained matching `.mermaid-figure` styles.
  - Standalone `.mmd` / `.mermaid` files get a diagram preview (with the usual
    preview/raw toggle) in the file viewer.
  - `BrainMarkdown`'s component overrides are now identity-stable across
    renders, so streaming deltas no longer unmount/remount every code block.

### Minor Changes

- 2c42696: Extract the brain-ui deployment into two reusable packages.

  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-server`**: Hono app factory (`createApp`) with
    auth (password/passkeys/tailscale/proxy), the WebSocket turn coordinator
    (decomposed into explicit host objects: `WsHost`, `TurnCoordinator`,
    `SessionCatalog`), session catalog with bundled SQLite migrations, brain/
    files/voice routes, and injected seams for the static client build and the
    PNG/PDF renderer.
  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-react`**: the chat/files/voice React components,
    stores, and WS transport. The chat store now keeps a transcript buffer per
    session (plus a draft buffer), so background sessions accumulate instead of
    being discarded. Ships prebuilt JS + d.ts, a precompiled `styles.css`, and a
    `theme.css` source entry for Tailwind v4 consumers. Branding copy is
    configurable via `configureBrainUi()`.
  - **ui-sdk**: add `PasskeySummary` to the protocol (REST payload of the
    passkey management routes, previously local to brain-ui).
