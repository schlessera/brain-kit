# @schlessera/brain-ui-react

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- - Fixed: hiding or unhiding a model in Settings → Models now updates the
    composer's model picker immediately, instead of only after a page reload.
  - Fixed: a session pinned to a hidden model showed "Default model" in the
    picker; it shows the pinned model's id.
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2904074: - Added: the model picker is discovered from the Anthropic Models API, so a new
  model appears without an env edit or a redeploy.
  - Added: a Settings screen (Models | Security) to hide models from the picker
    and refresh the list on demand.
  - Added: `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_DISCOVERY` and `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_TTL_HOURS`.
  - Changed: `BRAIN_UI_CLAUDE_PROFILES` is now only for non-Anthropic endpoints
    and for overriding a discovered model.
  - Changed: `useUIStore`'s `securityPanelOpen` / `toggleSecurityPanel` /
    `setSecurityPanelOpen` are now `settingsPanelOpen` / `toggleSettingsPanel` /
    `setSettingsPanelOpen`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c42696: Extract the brain-ui deployment into two reusable packages.

  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-server`**: Hono app factory (`createApp`) with
    auth (password/passkeys/tailscale/proxy), the WebSocket turn coordinator
    (decomposed into explicit host objects: `WsHost`, `TurnCoordinator`,
    `SessionCatalog`), session catalog with bundled SQLite migrations, brain/
    files/voice routes, and injected seams for the static client build and the
    PNG/PDF renderer.
  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-react`**: the chat/files/voice React components,
    stores, and WS transport. The chat store now keeps a transcript buffer per
    session (plus a draft buffer), so background sessions accumulate instead of
    being discarded. Ships prebuilt JS + d.ts, a precompiled `styles.css`, and a
    `theme.css` source entry for Tailwind v4 consumers. Branding copy is
    configurable via `configureBrainUi()`.
  - **ui-sdk**: add `PasskeySummary` to the protocol (REST payload of the
    passkey management routes, previously local to brain-ui).
