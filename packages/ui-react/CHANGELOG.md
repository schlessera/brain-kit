# @schlessera/brain-ui-react

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7e6a3: Added: mermaid diagrams get their own share menu (PNG / PDF / SVG / source) and a
  full-screen pan-and-zoom viewer, opened by tapping the diagram.
  Added: a chat-surface brief appended to the agent's system prompt —
  `buildSystemPromptAppend({ client, tools })` — covering diagrams, `<share>`
  blocks, wikilinks, raw-HTML and tool-narration rules, the ask-user and location
  tools, and what the reader's device can do. Each backend declares its own tool
  names (pi has no location tool), and both take a `systemPromptAppend` option to
  override the whole brief.
  Added: `chat_message` frames carry an optional `client` field
  (`ClientEnvironment`: form factor, touch, standalone, camera, microphone,
  geolocation, share sheet, viewport, locale, timezone), feature-detected in the
  browser and validated strictly at the boundary. The Claude backend rebuilds its
  system-prompt append per turn from it.
  Changed: diagrams render in a theme built from the app's own tokens instead of
  mermaid's stock dark/neutral themes; exports use the matching light theme.
  Changed: `MermaidTheme` is now `"dark" | "light"` (was `"dark" | "neutral"`),
  `ShareMenu`'s `renderTrigger` also receives `status` and `icon`, and the
  server-internal `handleChatMessage` takes an options object.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1f7e6a3]
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.9.0

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2868ba6: Mermaid diagram support across all render surfaces.

  - ` ```mermaid ` (and ` ```mmd `) fences render as diagrams in chat messages,
    the markdown file previewer, `<share>` block previews, Write-tool previews,
    and the "What's up" briefing — one hook in `BrainMarkdown`, so every surface
    gets it.
  - Streaming-safe: while a fence is still arriving the raw source shows as an
    ordinary code block; debounced parses (with a 400ms throttle floor) upgrade
    it to a diagram as soon as the source parses, and a failed parse keeps the
    last good SVG instead of flashing an error. Renders are cached, so per-token
    re-renders of a streaming message cost a lookup.
  - Mermaid (~2MB) loads lazily on first diagram; `securityLevel: "strict"` and
    `suppressErrorRendering` are set.
  - Share as PNG/PDF pre-renders fences to inline SVG on the client
    (`inlineMermaidDiagrams`, light "neutral" theme) before `POST /api/render`,
    since the render page runs without JavaScript or network. ui-server's share
    template gained matching `.mermaid-figure` styles.
  - Standalone `.mmd` / `.mermaid` files get a diagram preview (with the usual
    preview/raw toggle) in the file viewer.
  - `BrainMarkdown`'s component overrides are now identity-stable across
    renders, so streaming deltas no longer unmount/remount every code block.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Graph view: suppress node hover while a camera gesture (drag pan, pinch zoom/rotate) is in progress, so dragging no longer flickers random nodes in and out of the hover fade.
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.7.2

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 411bbbc: Graph view UX polish: theme-dark hover label plate (readable light-on-dark
  text), half-strength fade of non-matching nodes during search highlight,
  thin background-color outlines on canvas labels for overlapping text, and
  the node popover's community label rendered as an explicit "Topic:" chip.
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.7.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b8cbf72: Knowledge-graph view: `brain graph` command and schema-v8 derived tables
  (metrics, communities, root distances, precomputed ForceAtlas2 layout) built
  at index time; `/api/graph/*` REST endpoints served from read-only brain.db
  access; a full-screen GraphPage with Clusters, Discovery, Local, and
  Maintenance modes rendered via a lazy-loaded sigma.js WebGL canvas.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b8cbf72]
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.7.0

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix Deepgram voice input: present the minted token as `bearer`, not `token`

  The server mints a short-lived `/v1/auth/grant` access token, but the client
  still offered it with the raw-API-key subprotocol scheme
  (`["token", …]`). Deepgram rejects that handshake outright — no 101, close code
  1002 — so the mic sheet opened, the recorder started, and the sheet closed again
  a moment later with no transcript. Voice has been broken this way since the
  grant-only change removed the master-key fallback: that change swapped the
  credential type without swapping the scheme word.

### Patch Changes

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- The Search and Add quick actions do something now. Both were stubs that cleared
  the composer and focused it, so the "Search..." card on the new-conversation
  screen (and `/search`, `/add` in the command palette) looked like a no-op that
  dropped you into an empty chat.

  - **Search** opens a panel that queries `brain search` as you type (debounced,
    superseded requests aborted), highlights the matched terms, strips the
    markdown noise out of snippets, and opens the hit in the file viewer. Arrow
    keys pick, Enter opens. Degraded-mode warnings from the CLI are shown.
  - **Add** opens a form — note, optional title, type (completed from the types
    already in the brain) and tags — and posts it to `brain add`.

  Both talk to the brain CLI over REST rather than to the agent, so they stay
  available while a turn is streaming or the socket is down.

### Patch Changes

- @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.6.0

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- - Fixed: hiding or unhiding a model in Settings → Models now updates the
    composer's model picker immediately, instead of only after a page reload.
  - Fixed: a session pinned to a hidden model showed "Default model" in the
    picker; it shows the pinned model's id.
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2904074: - Added: the model picker is discovered from the Anthropic Models API, so a new
  model appears without an env edit or a redeploy.
  - Added: a Settings screen (Models | Security) to hide models from the picker
    and refresh the list on demand.
  - Added: `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_DISCOVERY` and `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_TTL_HOURS`.
  - Changed: `BRAIN_UI_CLAUDE_PROFILES` is now only for non-Anthropic endpoints
    and for overriding a discovered model.
  - Changed: `useUIStore`'s `securityPanelOpen` / `toggleSecurityPanel` /
    `setSecurityPanelOpen` are now `settingsPanelOpen` / `toggleSettingsPanel` /
    `setSettingsPanelOpen`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [2904074]
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c42696: Extract the brain-ui deployment into two reusable packages.

  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-server`**: Hono app factory (`createApp`) with
    auth (password/passkeys/tailscale/proxy), the WebSocket turn coordinator
    (decomposed into explicit host objects: `WsHost`, `TurnCoordinator`,
    `SessionCatalog`), session catalog with bundled SQLite migrations, brain/
    files/voice routes, and injected seams for the static client build and the
    PNG/PDF renderer.
  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-react`**: the chat/files/voice React components,
    stores, and WS transport. The chat store now keeps a transcript buffer per
    session (plus a draft buffer), so background sessions accumulate instead of
    being discarded. Ships prebuilt JS + d.ts, a precompiled `styles.css`, and a
    `theme.css` source entry for Tailwind v4 consumers. Branding copy is
    configurable via `configureBrainUi()`.
  - **ui-sdk**: add `PasskeySummary` to the protocol (REST payload of the
    passkey management routes, previously local to brain-ui).

### Patch Changes
