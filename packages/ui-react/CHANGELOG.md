### Minor Changes

- 42789e1: Take backend URL and dev-tools configuration through `configureBrainUi()`
  instead of reading `import.meta.env`.

  `ui-server` already resolves its configuration once at the edge and never
  touches the ambient environment below that point; this is the browser-side
  mirror. The package read `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and `DEV` at module load, which
  pinned it to Vite — a webpack or Next.js consumer had no way to reach a
  split-topology backend at all, and no way to discover that from the types.
  `scripts/check-env-access.ts` gained a fourth rule refusing `import.meta.env`
  anywhere in a package's `src`, so the loophole cannot reopen.

  **Breaking for direct importers:** the `API_BASE` constant is now the
  `apiBase()` function. A constant would freeze the value at import time, and ES
  imports are hoisted, so it would always capture the default rather than what
  the shell configured. `configureBrainUi` gains `backendUrl` (empty = the
  same-origin default) and `devTools`; both are optional.

- c79e632: Zoom images the way diagrams zoom, and stop treating quality as a problem

  An inline image is only as wide as the viewport, so a generated one was visible
  but not legible — the same complaint mermaid diagrams had before they got a
  viewer. Images now get that viewer, and the pan/zoom surface behind it is shared
  rather than copied.

  - **`ZoomViewer`** (`components/viewer/`) is the extracted stage: pointer pan,
    pinch and wheel zoom, fit/zoom/close toolbar, Escape, body-scroll lock,
    re-fit-while-untouched. `MermaidViewer` is now a thin wrapper over it and
    behaves exactly as before (diagrams still fit up to 250%; images cap fit at
    100%, since past that a raster shows only interpolation).
  - **Tapping an image opens it** — in chat markdown, in the file viewer's binary
    preview, and on a user message's attachment thumbnails (those are
    object-cover crops, so the full frame was not even visible before).
  - **Sharing an image is now two explicit actions.** "Share original" ships the
    bytes untouched; "Share optimized" re-encodes toward 2048px / 1 MiB for
    messaging, and falls back to the original when the image is already inside
    that target rather than recompressing for show. Nothing is downgraded
    silently, and the file on disk is never touched.
  - The `generate-pdf` skill's size guidance already said the 10 MB server cap is
    the only real ceiling; this makes the UI live up to it, because a
    full-resolution image is what makes zooming worth anything.

- 2be49b8: Pick up a system share and file it, behind one confirmation

  Third phase of the Android share target: the app now claims what the service
  worker stashed, shows it, and — once the user taps "Add to brain" — uploads it
  to the staging directory and starts a chat session whose first turn reads,
  stores and processes it. The user watches the tool timeline and keeps talking in
  the same session.

  **The confirmation is the security boundary, not a nicety.** The share target is
  reachable by any website: a page that auto-submits a cross-site form to it is
  indistinguishable from the system share sheet. Acting on a share automatically
  would let a drive-by write into the knowledge base, spend subscription credit,
  and put attacker-authored text in front of a model with tool access. So nothing
  is uploaded and no turn starts until the arriving share has been shown — title,
  url, text, thumbnails — and confirmed. A real share pays one tap.

  Shares queue and run one at a time. That is also a correctness requirement, not
  just pacing: the client holds a single unbound chat draft, so two turns started
  before the first `session_info` arrives would land in the same buffer and the
  second session's transcript would be dropped for the rest of the connection.

  `?share=<id>` is moved into a localStorage claim and stripped from the URL
  immediately, so the intake survives a login round-trip, a manual reload, and the
  shell's own service-worker auto-reload — a reload preserves the query string,
  and a second pass over the same id while the first upload was in flight would
  file the share twice. `ShareStore.take()` makes the claim atomic underneath
  that. Orphans are recovered from the stash by listing it, because a share whose
  landing page never ran leaves a record nobody holds the id for.

  `sendClientMessage()` is now exported from `use-websocket`: `useWebSocket()`
  owns the socket through a per-instance guard, so a second caller would build a
  second client and orphan the first. Anything that needs to send but not to own
  goes through the module-level sender, which reports failure instead of dropping
  silently.

  `hasPendingShare()` is exported for the deployment shell's reload guard —
  reloading mid-intake is exactly what the claim above protects against.

  The upload does not go through `api-client`: `fetchJson` hardcodes a JSON
  content type, which would break the multipart boundary, and flattens errors to a
  message, discarding the `limit` a 413 carries — the only thing that lets the
  card say which cap was hit.

- 2be49b8: Answer a system share in the service worker

  Second phase of the Android share target: `@schlessera/brain-ui-sdk/share-target`
  is a new export holding the service-worker half — `registerShareTarget()`,
  `handleShareTargetRequest()`, and an IndexedDB store that parks the payload
  until the app can upload it.

  A POST share target is a cross-site POST _navigation_, and it has to be answered
  locally rather than by a server route, for two independent reasons. The session
  cookie is `SameSite=Strict`, which is exactly the case such a navigation does not
  carry — a server route would see an unauthenticated request with the payload
  already consumed and unrecoverable. And answering locally keeps the payload on
  the device until the app is authenticated and online, so a share made offline or
  logged out is queued rather than lost. The handler therefore stashes the payload
  and redirects to the app with `?share=<id>`.

  It never rejects and never hangs: a browser mid-navigation has to land
  somewhere, so a body that will not parse (what Chrome produces when the
  manifest's `accept` lists an extension without its MIME type), an empty share, a
  share past the caps, or a store that refuses — or takes longer than five seconds
  to accept — the write each redirect with `?share_error=` for the app to explain.
  The timeout matters because `indexedDB.open()` can hang with no event at all on
  a corrupted backing store, and an unsettled response promise is a blank tab.

  The caps the server enforces are enforced here too, before anything touches the
  device: an oversized body is refused on `content-length` before `formData()`
  buffers it whole in the worker, and file count, per-file size, total size and
  text length are checked after parsing. Otherwise a share is written to the
  user's own phone first and only refused minutes later, on upload.

  `ShareStore.take()` reads and deletes in one transaction. The shell reloads
  itself when a new worker takes over and a reload keeps the query string, so
  `?share=<id>` can be read twice; the atomic claim is what stops one share being
  filed into the knowledge base twice.

  Anything reachable by the share sheet is also reachable by any website — a page
  that auto-submits a cross-site form to the action URL is indistinguishable from
  a real share, and `Sec-Fetch-Site` cannot tell them apart from inside a worker.
  A stashed share is therefore untrusted input, and the client intake that follows
  shows it on a confirmation card rather than acting on it.

  The stash is bounded: after each successful stash the handler prunes records
  older than `SHARE_STASH_TTL_MS` (24h), so a share abandoned behind a login
  prompt does not sit on the device holding whole files forever.

  No Workbox dependency — a plain `fetch` listener works with or without a router,
  and Workbox's own routes are GET-only by default, so nothing competes for the
  POST. It is a separate export subpath so a service worker can import it without
  dragging in the renderer and ASR registries that `./client` holds. Persistence
  stays concrete — the swap and in-memory implementations are named `*ForTests`
  and are not part of the package's public exports, so this is a test hook and
  not a storage seam.

  `@schlessera/brain-ui-react` gains a dev-only `ShareHarness` component: it posts
  the same multipart body to the same path from inside the page, through exactly
  the same handler, stash and redirect. Everything except the manifest
  registration itself can be verified without reinstalling the PWA — which on
  Android means waiting for a WebAPK update.

### Patch Changes

- a4eb4d0: Spell control and invisible characters as escapes so grep can see the source

  `chunkContextKey` embedded raw NUL bytes as hash field separators, which makes
  grep and ripgrep classify `indexer.ts` as binary — the file silently dropped out
  of every search. `brain-markdown.tsx` had the milder version: its entity
  delimiters were runs of one, two and three literal zero-width spaces, unreadable
  in a diff and destroyable by any editor that trims whitespace.

  Both now use escape sequences. The runtime strings are byte-identical, so
  existing `.context-cache.jsonl` keys still match and no LLM-generated context is
  regenerated.

  `bun run lint` (`scripts/check-invisibles.ts`) refuses raw control and invisible
  characters in tracked files and runs in CI as the invisible-character gate.

- e7e0092: Bound a session's follow-up queue by bytes instead of by message count

  `MAX_SESSION_QUEUE = 5` was a placeholder with no reasoning behind it, and it
  measured the wrong thing: a queue of five sentences and a queue of five
  four-image messages differ by roughly 50 MB, and only the second is a problem.
  Every queued entry is held in the host process (attachments still base64) until
  its turn runs.

  - **20 MiB warns, 50 MiB refuses.** Past the warn mark the message is still
    accepted and the `queued` status carries a `detail` note saying how much is
    parked; the server logs it too. Past the hard cap it is refused with
    `SESSION_QUEUE_FULL`, naming both the parked total and what the rejected
    message needed — an explicit error frame, never a silent drop.
  - **`MAX_SESSION_QUEUE` survives as a depth backstop, raised to 50.** Bytes do
    not bound count, and each entry becomes its own turn: ~500k one-line messages
    fit inside 50 MiB and would run a session for days.
  - `queuedFollowUpBytes` / `queuedBytes` (ui-server `ws/turns`) do the
    accounting, measuring the payload as it arrived on the wire.
  - The client stores the note per session (`queueNotes`) and the session drawer's
    Queued pill turns red and shows it on hover.

  Only affects backends without native follow-up — with `capabilities.followUp`
  (pi) messages go into the running turn and no host queue exists. The default
  Claude backend is the one that queues.

### Patch Changes

- 4281c59: Fix three things a real session on a phone turned up

  - **Images written into the brain did not display in chat.** The markdown
    renderer overrode headings, code and links but not `img`, so
    `![](assets/images/x.png)` resolved against the app origin and 404'd — the
    bytes are served by the files API. Repo-relative sources are now rewritten to
    that endpoint; `data:` URIs and absolute URLs pass through untouched.
  - **Scratch files had nowhere to go.** `brain render` and `brain image` refused
    any path outside the repo, which pushed intermediates — an HTML file that
    exists to be rendered two seconds later — into a knowledge base as git noise.
    Both now also accept paths under the system temp directory, report them
    absolute, and say that a file written there is not viewable in a UI. Anywhere
    else is still refused: this is scratch space, not free rein.
  - **The generate-pdf skill refused documents over 400 KB**, citing a file-viewer
    download limit that does not exist. The real ceiling is the file server's
    (10 MB, both the preview and raw paths); below that, size is a judgement call
    about the reader's connection. The skill no longer refuses to produce a
    document for being over an invented figure.

  Also corrects a comment on `FILE_SIZE_CAP_BYTES` claiming the `?raw=1` path was
  unbounded. It is not — `resolveForRaw` enforces the same cap, which is why
  raising it to 10 MB mattered for images and PDFs in the viewer too.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 604abbc: Add a mask bridge: the reader paints the region an image edit applies to

  Masked inpainting needs someone to point at part of a picture, and there is no
  server-side substitute for that. This mirrors the existing location bridge: the
  agent calls `mcp__brain-ui__request_image_mask`, the browser opens a canvas over
  the image, and the painted PNG comes back over the socket.

  - **ui-sdk** — `mask_request` / `mask_response` / `mask_error` frames, validated
    at the boundary with the same decoded-byte budget as a chat image, plus
    `BackendBridge.requestMask`.
  - **ui-server** — pending-mask state on the turn coordinator, the bridge method,
    and inbound routing. Cancels reject the promise like every other pending
    interactive request, so a disconnect mid-paint fails the tool instead of
    hanging the turn.
  - **ui-react** — a `MaskEditor` modal: paint with a sized brush, undo, clear.
    Strokes are drawn on a capped working canvas and rescaled to the source
    image's true pixel dimensions on export, so a mask drawn on a phone lines up
    with a 4K original. Painted pixels export as fully transparent, which is the
    convention the edit endpoint reads.
  - **ui-backend-claude** — the tool, auto-allowed like the other bridge tools
    (the editor itself is the approval), and a system-prompt line telling the
    agent to ask rather than guess coordinates.

  The mask is written next to its image and the path returned, because what
  consumes it is `brain image --mask <path>`.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7e6a3: Added: mermaid diagrams get their own share menu (PNG / PDF / SVG / source) and a
  full-screen pan-and-zoom viewer, opened by tapping the diagram.
  Added: a chat-surface brief appended to the agent's system prompt —
  `buildSystemPromptAppend({ client, tools })` — covering diagrams, `<share>`
  blocks, wikilinks, raw-HTML and tool-narration rules, the ask-user and location
  tools, and what the reader's device can do. Each backend declares its own tool
  names (pi has no location tool), and both take a `systemPromptAppend` option to
  override the whole brief.
  Added: `chat_message` frames carry an optional `client` field
  (`ClientEnvironment`: form factor, touch, standalone, camera, microphone,
  geolocation, share sheet, viewport, locale, timezone), feature-detected in the
  browser and validated strictly at the boundary. The Claude backend rebuilds its
  system-prompt append per turn from it.
  Changed: diagrams render in a theme built from the app's own tokens instead of
  mermaid's stock dark/neutral themes; exports use the matching light theme.
  Changed: `MermaidTheme` is now `"dark" | "light"` (was `"dark" | "neutral"`),
  `ShareMenu`'s `renderTrigger` also receives `status` and `icon`, and the
  server-internal `handleChatMessage` takes an options object.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2868ba6: Mermaid diagram support across all render surfaces.

  - ` ```mermaid ` (and ` ```mmd `) fences render as diagrams in chat messages,
    the markdown file previewer, `<share>` block previews, Write-tool previews,
    and the "What's up" briefing — one hook in `BrainMarkdown`, so every surface
    gets it.
  - Streaming-safe: while a fence is still arriving the raw source shows as an
    ordinary code block; debounced parses (with a 400ms throttle floor) upgrade
    it to a diagram as soon as the source parses, and a failed parse keeps the
    last good SVG instead of flashing an error. Renders are cached, so per-token
    re-renders of a streaming message cost a lookup.
  - Mermaid (~2MB) loads lazily on first diagram; `securityLevel: "strict"` and
    `suppressErrorRendering` are set.
  - Share as PNG/PDF pre-renders fences to inline SVG on the client
    (`inlineMermaidDiagrams`, light "neutral" theme) before `POST /api/render`,
    since the render page runs without JavaScript or network. ui-server's share
    template gained matching `.mermaid-figure` styles.
  - Standalone `.mmd` / `.mermaid` files get a diagram preview (with the usual
    preview/raw toggle) in the file viewer.
  - `BrainMarkdown`'s component overrides are now identity-stable across
    renders, so streaming deltas no longer unmount/remount every code block.

  thin background-color outlines on canvas labels for overlapping text, and
  the node popover's community label rendered as an explicit "Topic:" chip.

  (metrics, communities, root distances, precomputed ForceAtlas2 layout) built

  access; a full-screen GraphPage with Clusters, Discovery, Local, and
  Maintenance modes rendered via a lazy-loaded sigma.js WebGL canvas.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix Deepgram voice input: present the minted token as `bearer`, not `token`

  The server mints a short-lived `/v1/auth/grant` access token, but the client
  still offered it with the raw-API-key subprotocol scheme
  (`["token", …]`). Deepgram rejects that handshake outright — no 101, close code
  1002 — so the mic sheet opened, the recorder started, and the sheet closed again
  a moment later with no transcript. Voice has been broken this way since the
  grant-only change removed the master-key fallback: that change swapped the
  credential type without swapping the scheme word.

### Minor Changes

- The Search and Add quick actions do something now. Both were stubs that cleared
  the composer and focused it, so the "Search..." card on the new-conversation
  screen (and `/search`, `/add` in the command palette) looked like a no-op that
  dropped you into an empty chat.

  - **Search** opens a panel that queries `brain search` as you type (debounced,
    superseded requests aborted), highlights the matched terms, strips the
    markdown noise out of snippets, and opens the hit in the file viewer. Arrow
    keys pick, Enter opens. Degraded-mode warnings from the CLI are shown.
  - **Add** opens a form — note, optional title, type (completed from the types
    already in the brain) and tags — and posts it to `brain add`.

  Both talk to the brain CLI over REST rather than to the agent, so they stay
  available while a turn is streaming or the socket is down.

### Patch Changes

- - Fixed: hiding or unhiding a model in Settings → Models now updates the

    picker; it shows the pinned model's id.
  - @schlessera/brain-ui-sdk@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2904074: - Added: the model picker is discovered from the Anthropic Models API, so a new
  model appears without an env edit or a redeploy.
  - Added: a Settings screen (Models | Security) to hide models from the picker
    and refresh the list on demand.
  - Added: `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_DISCOVERY` and `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_TTL_HOURS`.
  - Changed: `BRAIN_UI_CLAUDE_PROFILES` is now only for non-Anthropic endpoints
    and for overriding a discovered model.
  - Changed: `useUIStore`'s `securityPanelOpen` / `toggleSecurityPanel` /
    `setSecurityPanelOpen` are now `settingsPanelOpen` / `toggleSettingsPanel` /
    `setSettingsPanelOpen`.

### Minor Changes

- 2c42696: Extract the brain-ui deployment into two reusable packages.

  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-server`**: Hono app factory (`createApp`) with
    auth (password/passkeys/tailscale/proxy), the WebSocket turn coordinator
    (decomposed into explicit host objects: `WsHost`, `TurnCoordinator`,
    `SessionCatalog`), session catalog with bundled SQLite migrations, brain/
    files/voice routes, and injected seams for the static client build and the
    PNG/PDF renderer.
  - **New `@schlessera/brain-ui-react`**: the chat/files/voice React components,
    stores, and WS transport. The chat store now keeps a transcript buffer per
    session (plus a draft buffer), so background sessions accumulate instead of
    being discarded. Ships prebuilt JS + d.ts, a precompiled `styles.css`, and a
    `theme.css` source entry for Tailwind v4 consumers. Branding copy is
    configurable via `configureBrainUi()`.
  - **ui-sdk**: add `PasskeySummary` to the protocol (REST payload of the
    passkey management routes, previously local to brain-ui).
