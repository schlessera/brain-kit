# @schlessera/brain-backend-pi

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- d4fcf65: "Always allow" per tool.

  - Approval cards gain an **Always allow** button: the host remembers the
    tool (server `settings` table) and answers its future requests without a
    card — for both backends and any extension/MCP tool, since the grant is
    applied host-side in the ws bridge before a card is ever emitted.
  - Permission requests now carry a `kind`: `"tool"` (grantable) vs
    `"command"` (a destructive-bash confirm-pattern confirmation). Kind
    "command" can neither be remembered nor auto-answered — the client hides
    the button and the host refuses a tampered `always` flag — so the
    destructive-command seatbelt stays per-use.
  - Settings → Models gains an **Always-allowed tools** list with per-tool
    revoke (`GET/DELETE /api/tool-permissions`).
  - Wire protocol: additive `always?: boolean` on `tool_approval`, additive
    `kind?` on `tool_approval_request` (re-delivered cards included).

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- afbe784: pi backend parallelism.

  - **Keyed locks replace the pi backend's global write mutex**: file writes
    lock per path, brain document tools share one key, and bash locks the
    repo-git key only for git-staging/history and brain-CLI write commands
    (`bashLockKey`, shared with the Claude backend via ui-sdk). Builds, greps
    and other read-shaped bash run lock-free, so pi's parallel sibling tool
    calls and parallel sessions actually execute in parallel. Injecting the
    legacy `writeLock` option restores whole-lock serialization.
  - **`subagent` fan-out**: the `pi-subagents` extension's tool joins the
    default allowlist (parity with Claude's auto-allowed Agent tool), and the
    system-prompt brief names it when the package is installed.
  - **Backend-honest execution brief**: `buildSystemPromptAppend` gains an
    `execution` option (subagent tool name, per-turn-process semantics,
    parallel tool calls). The Claude backend's text is unchanged; pi's brief
    now tells the model to batch independent tool calls (they run
    concurrently) and no longer references subagents it doesn't have.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b41fc3: pi backend parity with the Claude backend.

  - **Approvals**: mutations no longer each raise a card. A single `tool_call`
    permission gate (inline extension, fires before every tool — curated and
    extension-registered) implements the Claude posture: allowlisted tools run
    free, destructive bash shapes confirm (shared
    `DEFAULT_CONFIRM_BASH_PATTERNS`, moved to `brain-ui-sdk/server`),
    non-allowlisted tools ask. `brain_archive` keeps its card.
  - **Context**: both `AGENTS.md` AND `CLAUDE.md` load when the brain repo has
    both (pi previously took AGENTS.md alone — the Claude backend reads
    CLAUDE.md, so the two backends saw different instructions). The
    system-prompt append is now built per session from the opening turn's
    client environment and turn budget, like the Claude backend's per-turn
    brief.
  - **Tools**: curated surface extended to the full brain MCP set
    (`brain_read`, `brain_list`, `brain_graph`, `brain_update`,
    `brain_archive`) plus bridge-backed `get_current_location` (reverse
    geocoding shared via `brain-ui-sdk/server`), `query_activity`, and
    `request_image_mask`, each registered per host capability.
  - **Extensions**: `loadExtensions` now defaults to true — the gate covers
    extension tools. Recommended: `pi-web-access` (web search/fetch,
    auto-allowed like Claude's WebSearch/WebFetch) and `pi-mcp-adapter` (MCP
    servers from `.mcp.json`, prompted like non-allowlisted MCP tools).
  - **rtk**: when the `rtk` binary is on PATH, both backends route bash
    commands through rtk's rewrite oracle (`git status` → `rtk git status`,
    60-90% less output for the model to read). Applied after gating, so
    confirm patterns see the original command; absent rtk changes nothing.
  - **Upstream bump**: pi SDK 0.80.10 → 0.84.4 (`pi-coding-agent`,
    `pi-agent-core`, `pi-ai`). Verified: event mapping already delta-based
    (0.84's `message_update` change), auth already on the `ModelRuntime` API,
    extension install + load re-tested on 0.84.4.
  - **Web search settings**: new Settings → Models → "Web search" card (pi
    deployments only). Provider select defaults to Auto — Exa's free keyless
    tier — with per-provider API keys (Exa, OpenAI, Brave, Tavily, Perplexity,
    Firecrawl, Jina, Kagi, Gemini) stored server-side in the pi config dir's
    `web-search.json`, the file pi-web-access reads. Key values never travel to
    the client; hand-edited config fields beside the managed ones survive; a
    save clears pi's extension cache so new conversations pick the change up.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 02552ed: Per-model reasoning effort, editable in Settings → Models.

  - Effort-capable rows (the pi backend's profiles — Claude rows have no effort
    knob) get a tri-state effort select next to billing: "Default (<level>)"
    shows the configured level, an explicit pick is stored server-side
    (`PUT /api/models/thinking`, full record like hidden/billing) and applies
    to the NEXT new session — no env edit, no redeploy. Resumed sessions stay
    pinned.
  - `ProviderInfo.thinkingLevel` (additive) carries the effective level, and
    its presence marks a profile as effort-capable; `ModelCatalogEntry` gains
    `thinkingOverride`. `ThinkingLevel`/`THINKING_LEVELS`/`isThinkingLevel`
    join the sdk protocol.
  - `CreatePiBackendOptions.profiles` also accepts a function, re-read on every
    roster listing and model resolution, which is how the host applies settings
    overrides live.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 88c03d9: Configurable default model, user-managed OpenRouter models, auto-collapsing
  thinking.

  - **Default model** (Settings → Models): the profile used when a turn names
    none — a fresh device's first conversation, a share filed into the brain,
    host-initiated actions. Stored server-side; "Auto" prefers a CONNECTED
    subscription account (pi's `openai-codex` — probed via the new
    `hasStoredCredential()` export, a cheap read of pi's auth store) and falls
    back to the built-in default. The resolved default also leads
    `/api/providers`, so a fresh picker lands on it.
  - **OpenRouter models** (Settings → Models): add or remove models by id
    (e.g. `z.ai/glm-5.3-flash`) with no env edit or redeploy. Stored ids join
    the Claude roster as declared OpenRouter profiles (api-billed via
    `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`); removing the model behind the stored default resets
    the default to auto.
  - **Thinking sections auto-collapse** when their streaming completes,
    leaving the "Thought for ~N tokens" affordance to reopen them.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 472a2d0: Sign in to pi model providers from Settings — no shell on the host needed.

  - `@schlessera/brain-backend-pi` exports `createPiAuth()`: a headless OAuth
    service over pi's `ModelRuntime.login` that answers the method prompt with
    the device-code flow (the browser flow would bind a callback port on the
    server), captures the user code from the auth event stream, and exposes a
    start/poll/cancel/logout surface. Credentials persist through pi's own
    locked store (`~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` aware), so a
    login is immediately visible to the chat backend.
  - ui-server mounts `/api/pi-auth/*` behind the auth guard, lazily loading the
    optional pi package; provider ids are validated against the configured
    roster's vendors, and the endpoints report an empty provider list when pi
    is not in play.
  - Settings → Models grows an **Accounts** section (hidden on Claude-only
    deployments): Connect shows the device code and verification link, polls to
    completion, and Disconnect removes the stored credential. This is the
    intended path for connecting OpenAI (ChatGPT Plus/Pro) for the
    `openai-codex` gpt profiles.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a1c6c5: Run the pi backend alongside Claude, with declared model profiles — the path
  to OpenAI models under a ChatGPT subscription.

  - New `BRAIN_UI_PI_PROFILES` env var (JSON array of
    `{id,label,vendor,model,thinkingLevel?}`): when set with the default
    `AGENT_BACKEND=claude`, the pi backend joins the registry and its profiles
    join the picker. pi-ai's built-in `openai-codex` vendor authenticates only
    via ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth (`pi login`, device-code capable), so e.g.
    `{"id":"gpt-sol","label":"GPT-5.6 Sol","vendor":"openai-codex","model":"gpt-5.6-sol","thinkingLevel":"xhigh"}`
    runs on the subscription, not API tokens.
  - Fail-loud everywhere a wrong-but-plausible default could hide: malformed
    profiles JSON, duplicate/reserved ids (`default`, `claude`, `claude-*`),
    and invalid thinking levels refuse at boot; a missing pi package with the
    variable set refuses at boot; a declared vendor/model absent from pi's
    catalog rejects the turn instead of letting pi pick a provider; a resume
    whose saved model is unavailable rejects instead of silently substituting.
  - Billing classification keys on the profile vendor: `openai-codex` →
    subscription, other pi vendors (ambient API keys) → api. Claude
    classification is unchanged.
  - `PiProfile` gains `thinkingLevel` (passed to new sessions; pi clamps to the
    model's capability).

### Patch Changes

- d4261bb: Complete the per-backend tool-call rendering abstraction.

  The renderer registry was already backend-scoped, but the timeline hardcoded
  `backend: "claude"`, three code paths bypassed the registry (header label,
  touched-file summary, subagent-row gating), and risk advisories keyed on
  Claude tool names — so pi tool calls fell to the generic tier and risky pi
  `bash`/`write_file` inputs raised no approval-card advisories.

  - `session_info` now carries `backendId` (rev 3, additive); backends stamp
    their own, the host stamps stored sessions on resume/reattach. The client
    records it per session and scopes renderer resolution with it.
  - `ToolRenderer` grows `label`, `touchedFile`, `subagentRows`, and a
    backend-neutral `semantics` contract (`command`/`writePath`/`unsandboxed`);
    the timeline consumes only the renderer, no more name switches.
  - Risk rules now test semantics instead of Claude tool names, with a
    shape-sniffing fallback for renderers that declare none — the same rm -rf /
    force-push / curl|sh / writes-outside-repo advisories fire for every
    backend.
  - New pi renderer pack: `bash`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`,
    `grep`, `brain_search`, `brain_context`, `brain_add` render with the same
    dedicated views (diff, file write, command, grep rows) as the Claude pack;
    pi's bare `ask_user` is recognized by the ask-user card grouping.

## 0.20.0

### Patch Changes

- 00565d5: Activity-layer review follow-ups (the items deferred from the 0.19.0 review):

  - **Watchdog** (ui-server): a per-job stuck-threshold override below the
    default now actually fires — the scan uses the smallest effective
    threshold, the per-span check still applies each job's own.
  - **Push retry** (ui-server): `send_failed` intents are retried with a
    3-attempt budget and 5-minute backoff (migration 009 adds
    `send_attempts`) — a transient push-service failure no longer forfeits
    push delivery for that notification.
  - **Restart notification** (ui-server): turns interrupted by a server
    restart now produce a failure intent — the boot orphan sweep runs after
    the notifier exists, so its terminal writes are seen by the first tick.
  - **Digest** (ui-server): generation is one immediate transaction and the
    covered-until write is monotonic — a manual run racing the cron job can
    no longer double-count a window or regress the retention floor.
  - **Prune index** (ui-server): migration 009 adds the partial index the
    hourly prune's candidate query needed and drops the unused
    `idx_activity_spans_session`.
  - **PushToggle** (ui-react): now performs the server-disagreement check —
    a subscription bound to a stale VAPID key is dropped (surfacing the
    re-enable button) and a server-side pruned row is healed by re-asserting
    the subscription.
  - **Span naming** (ui-sdk): the `execute_tool <name>`/`invoke_agent`
    convention is now exported protocol constants
    (`SPAN_OP_EXECUTE_TOOL`, `SPAN_OP_INVOKE_AGENT`, `SPAN_TOOL_NAME_PREFIX`)
    instead of three independent restatements.
  - **pi usage** (backend-pi): the turn-usage accumulator narrows the SDK's
    typed `message_end` variant instead of a hand-rolled double cast.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- b15b5f0: Agent observability: a full activity layer across the stack.

  - **Activity record** (ui-server): an OTel-GenAI-aligned span store in the
    server SQLite records every turn, tool call, subagent run and cron run as
    a tree — written at start, closed write-once with a six-outcome taxonomy
    (`denied` and `interrupted` are first-class), with boot/staleness sweepers
    (heartbeat-keyed), a stuck-run watchdog, per-run rollups that survive
    pruning forever, and a digest-floor + hard-ceiling retention policy.
  - **Wire protocol** (ui-sdk, rev 3 additive): view-scoped
    `activity_subscribe`/`activity_snapshot`/`activity_delta` frames with a
    seq-discard ordering contract, a `usage` block (per-model token/cost
    breakdown) on `result`, and subagent linkage (`parentToolUseId`) on tool
    frames. `server_hello` advertises `capabilities.activity`.
  - **Backends**: the Claude adapter stops flattening subagent activity
    (task lifecycle, per-subagent usage, forwarded transcripts to the new
    bridge side channel; `forwardSubagentText` on; SDK floor 0.3.241) and
    reports full `modelUsage`; the pi backend reports per-turn token usage
    from its event stream. The new read-only `mcp__brain-ui__query_activity`
    tool lets the agent answer "what ran / what is running?" from the record.
  - **UI** (ui-react): live subagent rows with a stacked drill-in view
    (observation-shaped; approvals actionable there and in the chat), one
    server clock for live and reloaded duration badges, and a first-class
    Activity surface — live runs, history, rollup cards, failure inbox with
    nav badges, a while-you-were-away digest card, and a three-state web-push
    toggle. Activity takes the mobile tab-bar slot; Graph moves to More.
  - **Notifications** (ui-server): persisted intents (at-least-once, storm-
    capped, watched-suppressed) with an in-app inbox as the guaranteed tier
    and web push (generated VAPID keys in a secret-classified table,
    per-device subscriptions, minimized payloads, 404/410 pruning) on top.
  - `getCronStatus` now lists every recorded job name, closing the gap that
    hid module jobs from `/api/status`; the sessions listing merges stored
    cost accounting over backend zeros.

  - @schlessera/brain@0.18.0

## 0.17.0

### Patch Changes

- Pin the whole @earendil-works family at one exact version (0.80.10): with
  the pins split across versions, a fresh install nested an incompatible
  pi-ai copy under pi-coding-agent and the backend failed at import time. A
  release guard now enforces pin coherence.

- 210446f: Unify boolean environment parsing across all packages: every boolean variable
  now accepts 1/true/on/yes and 0/false/off/no (case-insensitive, trimmed), and
  an unset, empty, or unrecognised value falls back to the variable's documented
  default instead of being misread. Defaults and directions are unchanged;
  previously `"1"`-only flags (the Chrome sandbox switches, `TRUST_PROXY`,
  `BRAIN_UI_DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_AUTH`, `BRAIN_UI_ALLOW_PASSWORD`,
  `BRAIN_UI_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_ORIGIN`) accept the full truthy set, and the disable
  set for `BRAIN_UI_REVERSE_GEOCODE` / `BRAIN_UI_MODEL_DISCOVERY` gains `no`.
  `NO_COLOR` keeps its presence-based contract. Published descriptor types
  (`ENV_VARS` shapes) are unchanged.
- b84e70f: Finish wiring the observability layer through the server: report what already failed silently.

  The layer itself was sound — OpenTelemetry API on the producing side, our own
  console/recording/in-memory consumers on the other — but adoption stopped at
  two instruments, so most failures still answered the browser and left no
  server-side trace.

  - Turn lifecycle: every turn now emits "turn started" / "turn completed"
    (INFO, with `session.id` / `turn.id` / `profile` and duration), and every
    turn-failure path that previously only sent an error frame — SESSION_BUSY,
    BACKEND_REQUEST_ERROR, BACKEND_ERROR, FOLLOWUP_FAILED, SESSION_LOAD_ERROR —
    also logs (WARN for busy, ERROR otherwise) and feeds a `turns.failed`
    counter keyed by the bounded error code. `turns.started` / `turns.completed`
    counters and the turn-timeout WARN's correlation ids come with it.
  - Auth: password logins are observable — WARN on a failed password and on the
    rate limit, INFO on success, and a distinct ERROR when `Bun.password.verify`
    throws (a corrupt BRAIN_UI_PASSWORD_HASH is no longer reported as a wrong
    password). Failures land on the same `auth.failures` counter passkeys use.
  - Request logging now runs through the observability layer (method, path,
    status, duration; no query strings or bodies) instead of hono's raw-console
    `logger()`, so BRAIN_UI_LOG_LEVEL governs it; `/api/health` is skipped.
  - `/api/health` performs a SELECT 1 liveness probe of the app database and
    answers 503 `{"status":"unhealthy"}` when it fails — the Docker healthcheck
    no longer reports healthy over a wedged SQLite handle.
  - The dead `log?` seams (graph/files/share/render/models routes, settings,
    keyterm builder, share staging, the backend registry) actually receive a
    logger from `createApp`, and session-catalog write failures WARN with the
    session id instead of being swallowed.
  - New `recordCronRun(db, jobName)` export lets an external scheduler (the
    container crontab in the shipped deployment) record runs into `cron_runs`,
    so `/api/status`'s `cronJobs` reflects what actually ran.
  - WebSocket: the upgrade handlers gained `onError` (WARN + `ws.errors`
    counter), and broadcast send failures count on `ws.frames.dropped` with
    reason `broadcast_send_failed`, direction `outbound`.
  - Backends take an optional minimal `log` callback (no OTel dependency):
    the Claude backend routes its unparseable-confirmBashPatterns warning
    through it (console.warn only when standalone), and the pi backend's
    resource-loader fallback — which silently dropped the chat-surface
    system-prompt append — now says so.

- 6e1fd43: Fix per-connection protocol state never reaching the WS dispatcher (declared
  protocolRev was dropped, so the rev-3 turnId-echo requirement was never
  enforced), extract the tool-view diff engine into `lib/diff.ts`, and clean up
  dead imports/variables surfaced by the new oxlint gate.
- a714ee1: Per-package `test` scripts now pass `--timeout 30000`, so `bun run test` inside a package no longer flakes on bun's 5s default when suites spawn the CLI.
- ef519d1: Harden the publish surface: what a consumer installs now matches what the
  declarations, bundler and runtime actually reach for.

  - `@schlessera/brain-backend-pi` declares `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`
    (exact-pinned, like its sibling pi pins) instead of borrowing it from
    hoisting — its public `history.d.ts` types reference the package, so a
    strict installer (pnpm, npm with isolated modes) could not typecheck it.
  - `@schlessera/brain-ui-react` sets `sideEffects` to `["**/*.css"]` — the
    blanket `false` licensed bundlers to tree-shake a direct
    `import "@schlessera/brain-ui-react/styles.css"` away entirely.
  - `./theme.css` now resolves from `dist/` (copied verbatim at build) like
    `./styles.css` already did, so both stylesheets survive a dist-only tarball
    and the export map is uniform. The import specifier is unchanged.
  - `@schlessera/brain-module-finance`, `-images` and `-speaking` declare the
    same optional `@types/bun` peer that `-jobs` already carried: their module
    declaration graphs reach `bun:sqlite` types through `@schlessera/brain`.
  - Every package exports `"./package.json"` — tooling like Vite, Tailwind and
    Jest stats it, and the export map previously made that unreachable.
  - `engines.bun` is aligned with reality: bun-runtime packages require
    `>=1.3.5` (the CVE-2026-24910 floor `brain doctor` warns below), and
    packages that import cleanly under plain Node carry no bun engines field.
    Scrape keeps its (bumped) engines despite importing node-clean: its proxy
    fetch path shells out through `Bun.spawn`, so the runtime constraint is
    real even though the import is not.
  - Backend loading in `@schlessera/brain-ui-server` uses `await import()`
    instead of CJS `require()`, and only "the backend package itself is not
    installed" maps to the install-hint error. An installed-but-broken backend
    (missing transitive dep, syntax error, `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`) now surfaces its
    real error instead of a misleading "not installed".

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 59de559: - Added: every package reads the environment in one chokepoint that declares
  each variable, exports the contract (`ENV_VARS`, `resolveEnv`, `readEnvVar`)
  from the package entry, and generates its README env table from it.
  - Added: `ui-server` exports a resolved `ServerConfig` and returns an app handle
    (`config`, `db`, `wsHost`, `isTurnActive`, `cancelActiveTurns`, `close`), so
    two differently-configured apps coexist in one process.
  - Added: `openBrainDb`/`withBrainDb` gate every `brain.db` read on
    `schema_version`; `assertBackendResolvable` refuses to boot when the selected
    agent backend is not installed.
  - Changed: `@schlessera/brain-backend-claude` is an optional peer of
    `ui-server`, not a dependency — a deployment declares the backend it uses.
  - Changed: the module contract carries the config generic through
    `CommandContext`, `HygieneContext` and `CommandModule`, so a module author no
    longer casts a value the loader already validated.
  - Changed: the Gemini providers no longer delete and restore `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    around client construction.
  - Removed: `configureDb`, `getDb`, `closeDb`, `configureWsHost`,
    `defaultWsHost`, `cancelActiveTurn`, `isTurnActive`, the `brainClient`
    namespace and the `getBackends`/`getBackendsInfo` module functions — their
    replacements live on the app handle.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7e6a3: Added: mermaid diagrams get their own share menu (PNG / PDF / SVG / source) and a
  full-screen pan-and-zoom viewer, opened by tapping the diagram.
  Added: a chat-surface brief appended to the agent's system prompt —
  `buildSystemPromptAppend({ client, tools })` — covering diagrams, `<share>`
  blocks, wikilinks, raw-HTML and tool-narration rules, the ask-user and location
  tools, and what the reader's device can do. Each backend declares its own tool
  names (pi has no location tool), and both take a `systemPromptAppend` option to
  override the whole brief.
  Added: `chat_message` frames carry an optional `client` field
  (`ClientEnvironment`: form factor, touch, standalone, camera, microphone,
  geolocation, share sheet, viewport, locale, timezone), feature-detected in the
  browser and validated strictly at the boundary. The Claude backend rebuilds its
  system-prompt append per turn from it.
  Changed: diagrams render in a theme built from the app's own tokens instead of
  mermaid's stock dark/neutral themes; exports use the matching light theme.
  Changed: `MermaidTheme` is now `"dark" | "light"` (was `"dark" | "neutral"`),
  `ShareMenu`'s `renderTrigger` also receives `status` and `icon`, and the
  server-internal `handleChatMessage` takes an options object.
