The model can offer up to two follow-ups under its answer (#40). `show_block` gains a twelfth kind, `suggestions`: `label?` and `items[1..2]{label, icon?}`, each label one line of 4-80 characters. That is the data of the kit's `SuggestionChips` without `tone`, and a type test holds the two together in both directions. Both backends offer it through the tool description; the per-turn brief is unchanged.

`@schlessera/brain-ui-react` draws the turn's last valid call as the answer's closing row, a row of chips after the text and share menu, never where the call was made. A chip puts its words in the composer, below any draft, and never sends: no message, no answer to a pending question, no approval. The row is gone once the reader sends anything. It is not drawn while the turn runs, while a question in the turn is unanswered, when the answer ends in a question, while voice holds the composer, or on a turn spoken in a voice conversation. The client also drops duplicates, a restatement of the reader's own question, and generic filler. The decision reads only the transcript and current state, so a replayed session draws what the live one did. Shares and prints leave suggestions out, and the welcome chips are unchanged.
